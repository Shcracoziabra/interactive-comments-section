## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

The following requirements are fulfilled:

- First-level comments are ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal pops up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) - sub-atomic styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

- made use of React hooks useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useContext
- learned to use Open-props CSS variables to match the design needed
- worked with JS Date object methods and props to create custom time strings for comments created and edited timestamps
- checked page accessibility with the Chrome Screen reader for sighted users and for those, who uses keyboard
- worked with Local Storage to emulate CRUD operations
- wrote reducer function for the useReducer React hook to manipulate heavy state
- learned how to use several image types for optimization, if browser supports the type. the example html is below.

```html
  <picture>
    <source srcset="photo.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="photo.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo" />
  </picture>
```

### Continued development

I want to explore React hooks: useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useRef, useImperativeHandle.
In addition, learn deeper and recap React component's lifecycle and on what stages different hooks run.
